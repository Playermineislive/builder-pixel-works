## How to Test

### Step 1: User Registration and Login
1. Create two user accounts (User A and User B)
2. Both users log in to the application

### Step 2: Generate Invite Code
1. User A goes to the "Invite" tab
2. User A copies their invite code
3. Code is automatically registered with the server

### Step 3: Send Invite Request
1. User B goes to the contacts screen
2. User B clicks "Add Friend" button
3. User B enters User A's invite code
4. User B clicks the invite button
5. System shows "Invite request sent! Waiting for response..."

### Step 4: Receive and Respond
1. User A receives a real-time notification about the invite request
2. User A goes to the "Requests" tab
3. User A sees the pending invite request from User B
4. User A can click "Accept" (✅) or "Reject" (❌)

### Step 5: Final Notifications
- **If Accepted**: 
  - User A sees "You are now connected with [User B]!"
  - User B sees "Invite accepted! You can now chat."
  - Both users are added to each other's contact lists
  - They can now start chatting

- **If Rejected**:
  - User A sees "Declined invite request from [User B]"
  - User B sees "Sorry, they don't want to chat" message
  - No contact is added
