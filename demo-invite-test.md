# Invite Request System Test

## Issue Fixed

The user reported: "Request notification is coming but accept and reject page not coming"

## Root Cause

- Notifications were being created via polling in `ContactContext`
- However, these notifications were not being converted to `InviteRequest` objects
- The `InviteRequestCard` component requires `inviteRequests` array data
- Only notifications were being shown, but the actual requests tab didn't display the accept/reject interface

## Solution Applied

1. **Updated ContactContext polling logic** (lines 230-255):

   - Now updates both `inviteRequests` and `inviteNotifications` arrays
   - Ensures the requests tab shows the proper InviteRequestCard components

2. **Improved request cleanup**:
   - When accepting/rejecting requests, both arrays are properly updated
   - Removes related notifications when requests are processed

## Test Scenario

1. User A generates an invite code
2. User B uses that code to send an invite request
3. User A should see:
   - Notification overlay (toast-style notification)
   - Request in the "Requests" tab with accept/reject buttons
4. When User A accepts/rejects:
   - Request disappears from Requests tab
   - Notification is cleared
   - Appropriate feedback is shown

## Key Files Modified

- `client/contexts/ContactContext.tsx`: Fixed polling logic and request handling
- `client/components/InviteRequestCard.tsx`: Already working correctly
- `client/pages/ContactsList.tsx`: Already displaying requests correctly

## How to Test

1. Open the app and register/login as User A
2. Go to contacts and get your invite code from Invites tab
3. Open another browser/incognito window and register as User B
4. Use User A's invite code to send a request
5. Check User A's app - should see notification AND requests tab should show accept/reject interface
